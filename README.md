# linear_regression_tutorial-python-
tutorials in Python (inc. numpy & matplotlib) for linear regression
1) IPython notebook for fitting a straight line plus bootstrap and other methods for determine uncertainty/error estimates for the best-fit values of the intercept and slope
2) IPython notebook for fitting a power law plus bootstrap for determine uncertainty/error estimates for the best-fit value of the exponent
3) (NB bit rough and ready and may have a bug) IPython notebook for fitting a Gaussian to data - three parameter fit (height, position dnd width), ie assumes that baseline is zero, or in other words that far from peak data tend to zero. If you have baseline you will need to subtract it off befor fitting.
